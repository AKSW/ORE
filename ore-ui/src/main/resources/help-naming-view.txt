It is quite common in ontologies that a subclass has the same head noun as its parent class.<sup>1</sup> 
By an earlier study we estimated that in ontologies for 
technical domains this simple pattern is verified in 50–80% of class-subclass pairs such that the subclass name is a multi-token one. This number further increases 
if we consider thesaurus correspondence (synonymy and hypernymy) rather than literal string equality. In fact, the set-theoretic nature of taxonomic path entails that 
the correspondence of head nouns along this path should be close to 100% in principle; the only completely innocent deviations from it should 
be those caused by incomplete thesauri. In other words, any violation of head noun correspondence may potentially indicate a (smaller or greater) problem in the ontology. Prototypical situations are:
<ul>
<li>
Inadequate use of class-subclass relationship, typically in the place of whole-part or class-instance relationship, i.e., a conceptualisation error frequently 
occurring in novice ontologies.
</li>
<li>
Name shorthanding, typically manifested by use of adjective, such as ‘State-Owned’ (subclass of ‘Company’).
</li>
</ul>
While the former requires complex refactoring of the ontology fragment, the latter can be healed by propagation of the parent name down to the child name.

The head noun is typically the last token, but not always, in particular due to possible prepositional constructions, as, e.g., in ‘HeadOfDepartment’.
